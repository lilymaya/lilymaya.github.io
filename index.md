## **Biology 824 Assignment Week 3- Version Control with Git and Github**

---
> Here are some FAQs about Github!


1. **When should you use Git for a project?**

Github is a **version control system**. This has a number of awesome benefits for your project!

+ Github can track every change you make to a file, so you can always go back to look at all your steps. Similarly, if you make a mistake and ruin your work, you can always go back to old versions!

+ Github allows you to merge files with collaborators. Multiple people may work on a project at once, with a record of every change made by every person!

Github is great for solo workers and big teams- both will benefit from the tracked changes, and the team will benefit from easy collaboration!

2. **What kind of files/info should be saved in a Git repository? What types of files/info should not be included in a Git repo?**

Github is great for:

+ Text files- such as a big document that needs multiple edits, perhaps from multiple people!

+ Code- again, that might need several rounds of editing and perfecting!

However, Github cannot store large files, such as a huge dataset. Also, don’t forget that if your Github is public, **do not store any private information** as it will be accessible by anyone.

3. **What are the commands to undo a commit?**

4. **One of your repositories is in a “detached HEAD” state. How do you fix this?**

5. **Your boss has no idea what Git is or why you are using it. Explain the pros / cons of using Git for your research project. Explain the pros / cons of hosting your project in a public (or private) repository on Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab/etc.**
